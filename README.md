Some functions to solve crypto CTF challs

## RSA

<details>
<summary>Broadcast Attack</summary>
  This uses a broadcast attack to retrieve the original plaintext.
You should pass an array with the moduli as the first argument, an array with the ciphertexts as the second argument and the value of the public key e as the third argument.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Small e</summary>
This uses a Small e attack to retrieve the original plaintext. The first argument should be the ciphertext and the second argument should be the value of the public key e.
</details>

## XOR
* Simple XOR
* Tool to bruteforce the key

## Frequency analysis
* Compute occurrence of letters on a string
